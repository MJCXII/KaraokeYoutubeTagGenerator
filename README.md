# KaraokeYoutubeTagGenerator - 
This jar allows you to enter an Artist, Song Title, Decade and option for adding an addition specialist tag, then generate necessary youtube tags and copying them to clipboard.

This was developed for a small inhouse app for saving time in their production process, I used Java Swing to create the input fields and copied the ending results to clipboard.

# Example of entering in some of the information to generate the tags

You are given multiple fields that ask for the Artist, Song title, decade and an optional choice for any particular platforms the song relates to (for example TikTok famous songs)

# The result is then copied to clipboard
